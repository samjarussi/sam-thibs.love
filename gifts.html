        <h1>Why should you track your Talent Acquisition Analytics?</h1>
        <p>TA Analytics can help us to make smarter decisions, improve team efficiency and, therefore, hire better.
            <br>
        <p>Since when have we been hearing that the market is becoming increasingly complex and competitive? Let's be
            honest - the market is not becoming competitive. It has been competitive at least for a decade now (or even
            more!).
            I don't believe that hiring faster or more is key, at least not for us and not right now.
            Making better decisions and building stronger strategies is a business imperative to have better key
            contributors in your company and ensure that your team is delivering according to our realistic
            expectations.</p>

        <h3>What is TA Analytics?</h3>
        Talent Acquisition Analytics is the process of analyzing recruitment data and discovering insights that can help
        us to make better decisions and build stronger strategies. It is a data-focused approach that allows
        evidence-based decision-making to predict future performance.

        Maybe you consider your company to have a low analytics maturity compared to the high maturity organizations.
        Still, you do not need anything super complex to get there - you can even start with a simple spreadsheet and
        create your own dashboard! Of course, having an ATS will help you to automate some reports and gather data.
        Still, the magic happens when you and your team are diligent enough to ensure the data is accurate and updated
        and when you finally take the time to review and truly analyze it.

        We can compare it with your personal finances. Let's say you start tracking where your money goes, and you put
        together a spreadsheet to monitor your fixed and variable expenses, salary, savings, etc. What is the point of
        tracking where your money goes if you do not change the course of it? The change happens when you start tracking
        your money, analyzing your patterns, and establishing new goals. If you just track your money and still don't
        establish some goals, adopt some discipline and diligence, and start saving money on the 1st day of the month,
        nothing will happen. The only difference is that you are spending time looking at another spreadsheet.

        Another thing that I always say is: Recruitment is Sales. Our funnel or pyramid is very similar to theirs, and
        understanding this funnel helps us identify and solve bottlenecks.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Data helps you to:</strong>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Make evidence-based decisions in your recruitment process and strategy;</li>
            <li>Develop a roadmap for the journey;</li>
            <li>Understand your team capacity;</li>
            <li>Assign jobs within your team;</li>
            <li>Guide the hiring process;</li>
            <li>Create business impact and be legitimate while discussing with your stakeholders, understanding what
                they can gain from it;</li>
            <li>Make key improvements that will benefit both your candidates and organization;</li>
            <li>Gain the superpower to plan and make predictions!</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        It is the same thing regarding Talent Acquisition Analytics - the whole point here is to track and understand
        what is happening today, have some insights to establish new goals, keep an eye on some things, and improve
        them.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>First things first!</strong>
        <br><br>
        Define what you want to achieve with TA Analytics. Have a clear short and long-term goal.

        Why do you want to achieve it? Is it something that will improve your hiring process, or are you just changing
        it because the industry says so? Essential things to some companies may not be the most important thing to you.
        Hiring needs and stages are so different, and so are hiring strategies. Some companies want to attract the best
        Talent, and others want to hire more or faster, while others focus on cost reduction.

        Some of you will say, "I want to hire faster". Do you? Changing jobs is a life-changing event, and I don't
        expect my candidates to make this decision within ten days. I want to be respectful and give them the time, if
        they need it, to get to know us, to discuss it with their families and friends, and make a decision that will
        last.
        Hence, it would be best to think about what will make a difference in your reality.
        <br><br>
        <strong>What should we be looking at?</strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        Start looking at your activity: number of applicants, talent pool size, source of hires, time-to-fill,
        time-to-hire, sourcing activity (volume and sourcing channel effectiveness, for instance), interviews volume,
        yield ratio, cost, to name a few.
        <br><br>
        <strong>But what's next?</strong>
        <br><br>
        Gather the data, analyze it and identify what you want to improve.
        Ultimately, you'll want to change and improve everything but don't. Change occurs over time, and you'll not have
        the desired outcome if you do not have focus. Define just one thing to start with, that one thing that, if it
        changes, will make things better and smoother - work on this one thing only, and then on your next one thing,
        and so on.
        <br><br>
        <strong>How to identify your bottlenecks?</strong>
        <br><br>
        Look at the date that the intake meeting took place. Then start asking yourself some questions to identify where
        your bottlenecks are:
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>How many days did it take to start screening and interviewing the first candidates?</li>
            <li>When did you first reach out to the finalist? Did it take way longer? Why didn't you find this
                candidate at your first sourcing session, and how can you improve it next time? Assess your sourcing
                strategy, job boards, candidates' origin, and boolean search strings.</li>
            <li>What is your yield ratio?</li>
            <li>Which source and job board is more effective for each team and role?</li>
            <li>How much does it cost to hire a candidate?</li>
            <li>What is your ratio offer extend : accepted?</li>
            <li>What is the % of rejected offers?</li>
            <li>What is your time to fill? What is your time-to-hire?</li>
            <li>What is your funnel stats like?</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        These are all basic questions, but from there, you can start progressing and getting to more advanced ones.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Does it always work?</strong><br><br>
        Of course not! We still work with Talent, and people are the most unpredictable thing on earth. Talent
        Acquisition is not a science, and I hope it'll never be - it is an art and requires a specific skill set
        involving data analytics.
        Sometimes the hiring process is going so well, as you predicted, and the finalist will drop in the last
        interview or reject your offer. Other times, you will be in the right place at the right time and will find the
        perfect candidate without needing to use all the hours you forecasted at the beginning.
        It gives you knowledge about yourself, your company, your ecosystem, and a place to start.
        <br>
        Once you start recruiting for the same job position over and over again, you already have this place to start.
        You should know where you stand and own your data to make better predictions and decisions, inform your
        stakeholders more accurately and, most importantly, be aware of how, where and when to allocate your time,
        energy and efforts.
        <br>
        Once you are nailing it, you'll be ready to give the next step and maybe start analyzing your outreach campaigns
        and candidate experience survey results. Then, the hiring manager experience survey results. Soon enough, we'll
        be looking at Employer Branding and its KPIs. Let's talk about it in the future :)
